<strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong> - Social awareness can also be defined as social consciousness; to be conscious of the problems that different societies and communities face on a day-to-day basis. Everyday there are reports of unsocial activities in the society such as eve-teasing, molestation, student-ragging, power abusing, consumer frauds, thefts, etc. which has brought down the value of the morality in the modern society. In such cases, it is mostly up to the people to come forward and act together as one big family and try to minimize it. As said by Stephen R. Covey, "Every human has four endowments: self-awareness, conscience, independent will and creative imagination. These gives us the ultimate human freedom. The power to choose, to respond, to change." Certain questions do come in mind related to this:<br>

• Who are the people committing this crime and who are the victims affected ?<br>
• Where, how & why the crime is taking place ?<br>
• What are the measures that can be taken for this be minimized to as low as possible ?<br>
• How can this be analyzed by interaction with people willing to make the change ?<br>
• How can the news, ideas and awareness be spread ?<br>

<strong>IDEA PROPOSAL</strong>  - With the craze of social media from orkut to facebook, more people are used to internet nowadays. The objective was to create a website which will provide the platform for people to connect with each other, discuss, exchange ideas and take initiatives to make a collective change to the society. Although it is a big challenge, but then again 'Rome wasn't built in a day' and 'accumulation of several small drops creates an ocean'. There is facebook, world's biggest social network, then why 'Heal The World' ? It was only to be specific towards tackling the social evils of the society, joining hands with people who wants to make a change.<br>
